# versions 8-final

version 8 - can't type numbers after pressing equals
version 9 - trying to make it so multiple decimal points can't be used 
version 10 - fixed the multiple decimal point problem
version 11 - appears as version 9 in github
version 12 - got rid of def click, fixed zero division error (not actually version 12 githubs mucked around with the files)

Stuff I added at some point but can't accurately check cause the versions don't work properly. Making it so operators can't be entered after
operators exceptions for - sign.
fixed the leading number with a zero error
made the window not resisable
got rid of the coloured background that was red
changed what the UI looked like
changed max length of label
optimized the code to get rid of 40 lines for not_breaking_equals_2
fixed the syntax errors i could find
