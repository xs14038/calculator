version 1 - added buttons;  
version 2 - figured out how to colour buttons
version 3 - no major changes
version 4 - all buttons apart from delete work if used correctly
version 5 - all buttons work in intended manour, only bug fixes and design changes from here
version 6 - added a limit to the label output length as so typing wouldn't expand the window after to many imputs
